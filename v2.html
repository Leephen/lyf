        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Horn theft</h1>
        <p>A musical instrument store was robbed Saturday night. The thieves broke into the store by smashing a window through one of its doors. He broke open three money boxes and stole 1225 kron. he also took a loudspeaker worth 14,000 kronfrom a shop
            window and put it in an ordinary loudspeaker case and stole it.</p>
        <p>The police examined the scene carefully and concluded that the robbery was the work of someone familiar with the music store. The police narrowed their suspicions to three young apprentices, Hanson, Legg and Headley, and decided that one of them
            must be the culprit.</p>
        <p>The three boys were brought before Mr. Sorensen, the police officer, with three pens and three pieces of paper on the table. Sorensen told them, "I invited you here to ask you to cooperate with me and help me find the criminals. Now you write
            an essay. You pretend that you are a thief. Then you try to break into the shop and steal something. Okay, let's go. I'll roll in 30 minutes."</p>
        <p> After half an hour, Sorensen asked them to stop writing and read their essay.</p>

        <p>
            On Saturday morning, I took a closer look at the music store and decided that the backyard was the perfect place to start. In the evening I broke a window of a side door and climbed in. I got the change, then took a valuable horn from the
            <input type="button" value="window" onclick="alert('No glass appears to have been broken at the scene')"></input> and slipped out of the shop.

        <h2>Leg's describe</h2>
        <p>First I cut a big hole in the window with <input type="button" value="a diamond steel knife" onclick="alert('A sharp knife. There were not cut marks at the scene.No glass appears to have been broken at the scene')"></input>, so that no one would
            think I had done it.And I'm not going to open three money boxes, because it makes a noise. I'd get the horn, put it in a box, hide it under my coat, so people wouldn't notice.</p>

        <p>Late at night, In the dark, I pry open side doors of shops, with my dear favorite <input type="button" value="window" onclick="alert('A pair of ordinary gloves')"></input>on, steal money from pickpockets and horns from Windows. With the money,
            I will buy a pair of fur-lined leather gloves and sell this precious horn when the theft is forgotten.</p>
